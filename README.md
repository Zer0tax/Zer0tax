# About me.

**Zer0tax/Zer0tax** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an application to convert bank staements in .PDF format to ny own layout in Excel.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and some third party .PDF text-extraction and OCR tools.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the testing of my application.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have attended 9 different colleges.
